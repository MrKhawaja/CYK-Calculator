# CYK Calculator

# Introduction

I have created a script that will tell you if a string can be created or generated from a cnf using the cyk algorithm.

# Usage

You may directly replace the input options with these two

```
string = "abcccc"

grammar = '["S -> AB","A -> CD | CF","B -> c | EB","C -> a","D -> b","E -> c","F -> AD"]'
```

Or, you can just run the script and give input accordingly. Make sure to follow proper format for the cnf. It has to be a **List** of **Strings**. And maintain the spaces between `|` and `->`.
